But the Book of Jonas is not properly a Register of his Prophecy, (for that is contained in these few words, "Fourty dayes and Ninivy shall be destroyed,") but a History or Narration of his frowardenesse and disputing Gods commandements; so that there is small probability he should be the Author, seeing he is the subject of it. But the Book of Amos is his Prophecy.</p><p>Jeremiah, Abdias, Nahum, and Habakkuk prophecyed in the time of Josiah.</p><p>Ezekiel, Daniel, Aggeus, and Zacharias, in the Captivity.</p></div> </div>
