This Artificiall Eternity, is that which men call the Right of Succession.</p><p>There is no perfect forme of Government, where the disposing of the Succession is not in the present Soveraign. For if it be in any other particular Man, or private Assembly, it is in a person subject, and may be assumed by the Soveraign at his pleasure; and consequently the Right is in himselfe.</p></div> </div>
