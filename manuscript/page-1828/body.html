And therefore, when our Saviour, to Heathen, added Publican, he did forbid them to eat with a man Excommunicate.</p><p>As for keeping them out of their Synagogues, or places of Assembly, they had no Power to do it, but that of the owner of the place, whether he were Christian, or Heathen. And because all places are by right, in the Dominion of the Common-wealth; as well hee that was Excommunicated, as hee that never was Baptized, might enter into them by Commission from the Civill Magistrate;</p></div> </div>
