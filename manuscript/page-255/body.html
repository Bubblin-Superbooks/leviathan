<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Eloquence is Power; because it is seeming Prudence.</p><p>Forme is Power; because being a promise of Good, it recommendeth men to the favour of women and strangers.</p><p>The Sciences, are small Power; because not eminent; and therefore, not acknowledged in any man; nor are at all, but in a few; and in them, but of a few things. For Science is of that nature, as none can understand it to be, but such as in a good measure have attayned it.</p><p>Arts of publique use, as Fortification, making of Engines, and other Instruments of War; because they conferre to Defence, and Victory, are Power; And though the true Mother of them, be Science, namely the Mathematiques; yet, because they are brought into the Light, by the hand of the Artificer, they be esteemed (the Midwife passing with the vulgar for the Mother,) as his issue.</p></div> </div>
